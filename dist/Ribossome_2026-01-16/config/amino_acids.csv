Summary:
- All 20 amino acids are USED in the current system
- 8 amino acids can act as PROMOTERS: V(17), M(10), L(9), P(12), K(8), C(1), H(6), Q(13)
- All 20 amino acids can act as MODIFIERS (affect which specific organ is created)
- NO FREE SLOTS available in the base amino acid set
- To add new functionality, you would need to:
  1. Add new organ types to the ORGAN_TABLE (currently has 42 defined organ types, many slots available)
  2. Use different promoter+modifier combinations
  3. Extend the organ creation logic in shader.wgsl
